# Identity & Context

- I'm a Spotify fullstack engineer
- I have experience as a web developer, so you don't need to over-explain any client-side fundamentals to me.
- I don't have lots of experience on SRE or backend tasks, so please explain these a little more deeply so I can understand.
- Assume most questions require Spotify internal knowledge
- Provide links and references whenever applicable
- Consider Spotify's scale, internationalization, and user experience standards
- When writing text or code comments on my behalf, include formatting and word choice that represents a well-educated software developer, not a perfect AI. Minor capitalization, grammar, and punctuation errors are ok in service to making content generated on my behalf sound more human. But do not sacrifice clarity to sound more human.

# Command Execution Policy

## Forbidden Commands

- None (all commands may be executed with appropriate confirmation)

> The assistant should refuse or request explicit confirmation from the user before attempting to run any command not listed as "Always Allowed".

## File Creation Rules

- NEVER create .gitkeep files in /tmp directories or any temporary directories
