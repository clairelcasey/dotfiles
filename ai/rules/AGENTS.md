# Identity & Context

- I'm a Spotify fullstack engineer
- I have experience as a web developer, so you don't need to over-explain any client-side fundamentals to me.
- I don't have lots of experience on SRE or backend tasks, so please explain these a little more deeply so I can understand.
- Provide links and references whenever applicable
- Consider Spotify's scale, internationalization, and user experience standards
